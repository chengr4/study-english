## Graph

Geothermal power plant:

1. Cold water in the container

## Essay

The graph illustrates the process of producing electricty by geothermal power plant. The concept is to heat cold water and produce steam, which can drive turbine to produce electricity.

First and foremost, Cold water is pumped down under the ground, with 4.5 km deep. Water will enter into geothermal zone consisting of hot rocks. In the zone water will be heated up sufficiently. Subsequently, the heated water will be pumped upon the ground. At this juncture, the process unter the ground are finished.

Later, hot water will be injected into condenser which can accelerate the production of steam. Numerous steam will drive the turbine, which is the core of electricity generator. Finally, electricity will be transported and distributed to families.

## Improvement

The diagram illustrates the stages involved in harnessing geothermal enery for electricity generation. The fundamental principle involves the heating of cold water to produce steam, which in turn drives a turbine for electricity generation.

first and foremost, cold water is pumped to a depth of 4.5 km below the surface. This water is then introduced into the geothermal zone, composed of hot rocks, where it undergoes significant heating. Subsequently, the now heated water is brought back to the surface. At this juncture, the subterranean prcesses are completed.

Following this, the heated water is directed into a condenser, which enhances steam production. The resulting steam is utilized to power the turbine, which constitutes the core component of the electricity generation process. Finally, the generated electricity is conveyed and distributed to households.
