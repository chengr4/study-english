## Example

The pie charts illustrate energy consumption and resultant grennhouse gas emissions in an average Australian household, several key trends emerge. 

Notably, heating and water heating are **the primary contributors** to energy usage, comprising 42% and 30%, respectively. These two categories alone account for a substantial 72% of the total energy consumption. Interestly, refrigeration constitutus a significant portion at 7%, while cooling and lighting **play comparatively minor roles** at 2% and 4%, respectively. Other appliances Other apliances collectively contibute 15%.

When examining the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions, a clear coorelation with enery consumption patterns is evident. Water heating surpasses all other categories, generating 32% of emissions, closely followed by other appliances at 28%. Notably, the emission percentages for heating refrigeration and lighting mirror their respective energy consumption figures, with 15$, 14% and 8%. Cooling, though representing a modest 3% of emissions, constrasts with its meager 2% share in energy usage.
