## Example

The process of instant noodle production involves several key stages, as illustrated in the diagram. These stages encompass storage, mixing, dough formation, cooking and packaging.

First and foremost, the process commences with the storage of raw materials in silos, facilitated by a flour truck. Subsequently, these ingredients, including flour, water and oil, are mixed in a sepcialized apparatus. The resulting mixture is then rolle out into thin sheet of dough.

Following this, the dough is cut into strips, which are subsequently fashioned into individual noodle discs. These discs *are then subjected to a cooking process in oil*, ensuring the noodles are adequately prepared for consumption. after cooking, the noodles undergo a drying process to remove excess moisture.

In parallel, vegetables and spices are portioned into cups with noodles. These cups are then labeled and sealed, finalizing the packaging process. It is notale that while some stages in the production process are sequential, others occur concurrently. For instance, the mixing and dough formation are continuous, while the cooking and drying stages are distinct but subsequent.
