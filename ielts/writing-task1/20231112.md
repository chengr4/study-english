## Essay

The line chart illustrates average CO2 emissions perserson in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy and Portugal from 1967 to 2007. Overall, all four countries have its own characteristic and have no strong coorelation to each other.

It is apparent that both Portugal and Italy had increasing trend. In 1967, 4.2 metric tones of CO2 emissions were produced in Italy, while approximately 1.1 metric tones were emitted in Portugal. Over time, in 2007, it increased to 7.5 metric tones in Italy and each person made about 5 metric tones of CO2 in Portugal.

On the other hand, Sweden and United Kingdom represented decreasing tendency. For instance, United Kingdom emitted 10.8 metric tones of CO2 in 1967 and it declined to 8.8 in 2007. Interestingly, through it also displayed a decreasing tendency in Sweden entirely from 1967 to 2007, from 1967 to 1977, the emission of CO2 surged from 8.8 metric tones to 10.2 metric tones.

## Improvement

The line chart illustrates the average per capita CO2 emissions in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and Portugal spanning the years 1967 to 2007. Overall, each country exhibits distinct characteristics and there is no discernible strong correlation among them.

It is evident that both Portual and Italy experienced an upward 
trajectory in CO2 emissions. In 1967, Italy's emissions stood at 4.2 metric tons per person, while Portugal emitted approximately 1.1 metric tons. By 2007, these figures had risen to 7.5 metric tons in Italy and about 5 metric tons per person in Portugal.

Conversely, Sweden and the United Kingdom demonstrated a declining trend. In 1967, the United Kingdom's emissions were at 10.8 metric tons per person, decreasing to 8.8 metric tons by 2007. Notably, Sweden also showcased **an overall reduction** in emissions from 1967 to 2007. However, during the initial decade (1967 to 1977), Sweden's emissions rose from 8.8 metric tons to 10.2 metric tons before gradually declining thereafter.


- 國家在前: Italy produce 4.2 metric tons of CO2 emissions per person, while Portugal emitted approximated 1.1 metric tons.
