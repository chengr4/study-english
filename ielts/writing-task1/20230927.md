## Essay

The figure illustrates the manufacturing process for yielding suger from suger cane, involving 7 steps totally.

Firt and foremost, It is imperative to wait for sugar canes to grow, taking commonly 12 to 18 months. Followed with harvesting session, farmers have to cut canes down and collecting all of them. The collected canes are then crushed by a machine so that an ~amount~ of ~~original~~ raw juice is made and loaded. Until this step, half of process has been finished and the rest of works is to extract the juice and transform it to suger.

The next step is to make the juice purer. The factory uses a tool called limesstore filter to achieve it. The pure juice undergo a heating process by a machine called evaporator, resulting in syrup. There comes a process called "Centrifuge" that sperates sugar crystals from syrup. Finally, after drying and cooling suger, it becames the significant ingredient for our daily life.

## Improvement

The figure illustrates the seven-step manufacturing process of extracting sugar from sugar cane.

First and foremost, the cruical step involves waiting for the sugar canes to mature, which typically takes between 12 to 18 months. Following this, the canes are harvested, cut down and gathered. Subsequently, a machine is employed to crush the collected canes, producing a substantial amount of raw juice.

**At this juncture**, half of the process is completed, leaving the remaining steps focused on extracting and refining the juice into sugar. The next stage involves purifying the juice, accomplished through the utilization of a tool known as a limestone filter. The purified juice then undergoes a heating process in an evaporator, resulting in the formation of syrup.

The "Centrifuge" process comes into play, effectively separating sugar crystals from the syrup. Finally, after the sugar undergoes drying and cooling, it transforms into the essential ingredient for our daily consumption.

Overall, the process underscore the meticulous steps involved in transforming sugar cane into the sugar we commonly use.
