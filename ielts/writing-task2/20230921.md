## Essay

Whether to challenge the life or not is always a dilemma to everyone. Some people contend that people should take some risks in their life, while other individuals argue to have a stable and peaceful life is worth it. I wholeheartedly agree with the former idea but it should be according to a condition.

Not all people are suitable for a challenging life. It is undoubted that A life with safety and stability is also a kind of luck. After graduating from the university, it is absolutely unnecessay that being very compatitive just to go into a big tech company like Google or Being an CEO to undergo 16 hours daily works. Instead, Finding a stable job which may have a lower salary can offer a health scheduled life. However, I wonder to have life looking almost the same day by day can really be considered as "living".

A more active stance, one that resonates with my viewpoints, emphasizes the potential benefits of a challenge life. However, There is an imperative precondition: The financial stability should be sufficient. A lyrics saying "one way that cannot return twice" always reminds me that A life is short. It is pity that we do not challenge ourself when we are sill young. People will must gain something, even if they are failed. Therefore, I decide to go back to university to finish master that I have looked forward to having for a long time.

To sum up, we all have only one life. To avoiding disappointment and regretfulness from the future of us, Taking some risks to do whatever we would like to try.

## Improvement

In the midst of relentless societal progress, opportunities and risks always coexist. The decision to embrace risk in one's life is a lasting dilemma. Some advocate for the merits of venturing into uncertainty, while others argue for the value of a secure and peaseful existence. I wholeheartedly align with the former perspective, in spite of a caveat.

It is imperative to acknowledge that not everyone is inclined to a life of bold undertakings. Undoutedly, a life characterized by safety and stability constitutes a unique form of fortune. Upon graduating from university, the relentless pursuit of desired positions at tech giants such as Google or aspiring to be a CEO with 10-hour workdays may prove unnecessary. opting for a stable job, despite a modest salary, can grant **the gift of** a well-structured and balanced life. However, I find myself questioning whether a routine mirroring each passing day can truly be deemed as "living".

A more proactive stance, one that resonates with my viewpoints, emphasizes the potential benefits of a challenging life. However, a crucial precondition looms large: financial stability must be assured. The phrase "one way that cannot return twice" serves as constant reminder to me of **the unidirectinoality of life**. It would be a great pity if we did not challenge ourselves while we are still young. Even in the face of failure, **one stands to glean invaluable lessons**. Therefore, I decided to return to university to pursue a master's degree, a goal I have long coveted.

To sum up, **we only have one lifetime**. To alleviate future disappointment and regret, it is curcial to take some risks and pursue what we genuinely desire to try.
