In the midst of the relentless progress of technology, it is undeniable that we are presented with an overwhelming number of choices. Some people argue that this is too much. I wholehearted align with this viewpoint and believe that the internet plays plays a pivotal role in this phemomenon.

Relfecting on my own experiences, I am struck by the stark  contrast between my childhood and the present day. In the past, my family and I used to gathter around the TV to watch our favorite shows together. All members sit on the same couch and discussed about the same drama. However in today's digital age, each member of the household holds their own device, and the options available to us have got more and more. Platforms like Netflix, Youtube and Disney+ offer a number of content, allowing us to select the most appealing programs to watch rather than being constrained by what traditional TV channels have to offer.

Neverthless, this abundance of choices also brings with the challenge of distraction. For instance, when my mother and I sit down to enjoy a drama together, we often find ourselves divided between the program and our smartphones. This constant temptation to multitask can diminish the experience of the show and hinder meaningful connections with one another.

To sum up, the internet has undeniably expanded our horzons by providing us with an abundance of choices. However, it is crucial that we exercise caution and mindfulness in how we utilize this wealth of options.
