- on the other hand if teh job is only to face computers or other interior employees casual is find besides, Some research advocates that properly relaxed and raise performance of work

## Essay

In a diverse society, there are a multitude of types of jobs.While Some people *emphasize* the importance of dressing well, other individuals advocate the unnecessity of ~suiting~ up ~because~ the work performance plays a more ~pivotal~ role. I agree with this perspective to some degree.

Reflecting on my own experience, The center of this question depends on who to meet. For instance, If meeting customers is a daily mission, it is evident that people had better suit up. it not only ~highlights~ the professional culture of the company but also represents the respect to the customer and the project to cooperate.

On the other hand, for those not customer orientation jobs, I advocate to dress more casually. More and more ~research~ *indicate* that a proper ~causualness~ can ~apparently~ raises the ~effectiveness~ and performance of employees.

To sum up, A well-dressed employee can ~~bring positive impression to~~ leave a positive impression on customers, while an ~appropriate~ relaxing can encourage employees. Employers should consider *thoroughly* and find the optimized balance between both.

## Improvement

In a diverse society, there exists a wide range of professions, each with its own unique demands and expectations. While some emphasize the significance of dressing will, others argue that it is the quailty of one's work that should take precedence. I find merit in this perspective, albeit with some resercateions.

Relfecting on my own experience, the approprateness of attire depends on the nature of interactions. For instance, when dealing with clients on a regular basis, it is evident that **a formal dress code** is imperative. Not only does it underscore the professional ethos of the company, but it also serves as a gesture of respect towards both the client and collaborative endeavor.

On the other hand, in roles less focused on client-facing interactions, a more relaxed dress code is not only acceptable but often conductive to productivity. More and more reasearch indicated taht a comfortable dress code can enhance the efficiency and performance of employees.

To sum up, A well-presented employee undoubtedly leaves a positive impression on clients, while a comfortable dress code can foster a more preductive work enviroment. Employers should carefully weigh these considerations and **strike a judicious balance** between the two.
