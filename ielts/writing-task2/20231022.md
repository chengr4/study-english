- the population increases tremandously

## Essay

In the midst of the relentless progress of technology, the development of agriculture also becomes greater and greater and solves the most of hunger issues in the world. However, it seems that some people around the world still suffer hunger. From my perspective, there are two primary reason which leads to this result: the rapid surge of the population and the exceeding births of poor area.

It is evident that after the first industrial revolution, human beings stopped worries of food production and at the same time, the number of population began to increase rapidly. The rise of food production is not equal to a reasonable distribution of food for all individuals. Some areas is more dufficult to acquire food, contributing to the increase of prices and people, who can not undertake the price, thus suffer hunger.

Furthermore, exceeding births of porverty area are also regards as a crucial reason. A notable positive coorelation between the number of giving birth and people with porverty is a main and commonplace consensus. More kids represent the rise of food requirements. Children even have higher energy requirements than adults. Porverty suggests the difficulty of purchasing food, resulting a terrible cycle.

One solution sheds to my mind is eduation. By education, people are able to come up with a better approach to distribute food or enhance the transport efficiency so that food can arrive the target area quicker and more accurate. Moreover, people can control birth by teaching them the correct sexial notion.

To sum up, the surge of population in th world and exceeding baby births are two predominant reason causing undergoing hunger. By education, it is possible to alleviate the difficulty and enhance the well-being of all human beings.

## Improvement

In the midst of relentless technologial progress, advancements in agriculture have alleviated many of the world's hunger issues. However, it remains evident that a significant portion of the global population sill grapples with food insecurity. Form my perspective, two priamry factors contribute to this persisting problem: the rapid surge in population and the high birth rates in impoverished regions.

Following the first industrial revolution, humanity experienced a prfound shift in food production capabilities. Concurrently, the global population began to skyrocket. However, this surge in food production did not ranslate into equitable distribution for all individuals. Some regions face greater challenges in accessing food, leading to increasd proices that many cannot afford, resulting in widespread hunger.

Furthermore, the disproportionately high birth rates in impoverished areas play a critical role. There exists a well-established positive correlation between birth rates and poverty levels. More children mean higher food requirements as they have even greater energy needs that adults. Poverty further exacerbates the struggle to purchase adequate food, **perpetuating a vicious cycle.**

One solution that comes to mind is education. Through education, people can devise more effective strategies for food distribution and enhance transportation efficiency to ensure timely and accurate delivery to target areas. Moreover, imparting correct notions about reproductive health can help individuals make informed decisions about family planning.

To sum up, the surge in global population and the high birth rates in improverished regions are two primary factors contributing to ongoing hunger. Through education, it is possible to mitigate these challenges and improve the well-being of all individuals.

- ~~so that food can arrive the target area quicker and more accurate~~: to ensure timely and accurate delivery to target areas.
