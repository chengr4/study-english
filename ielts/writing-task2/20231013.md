## Ideas

- I think there are more important environmental problems.
- eg. Because of climate change, coastal cities are threatened by rising sea levels and easier get flooded.
- Sometimes loss of particular species of plants and animals is only a part of evolution of the ecosystem.

## Example

In the midst of relentless progress of technology, the discussion surrounding the environmental issues influenced by it has intensified, with varying opinions on which problems should take precedence. Some argue that the primary concern lies in the loss of specific plant and animal species, while others contend that some more pressing issues* warrant greater attention*. I wholeheartedly algin with the latter view, believing that boader environmental challenges, particularly those linked to climate change, demand immediate and sustained action.

One compelling argument favoring the prioritization of climate change is the peril it poses to coastal cities. *As global temperatures rise, polar ice caps are melting at an alarming rate, leading to a rise in sea levels.* This phenomenon directly threatens coastal communities, placing them at risk of inundation. Fot instance, some areas of western Taiwan have aleady experienced frequent and severe flooding events, with deastating consequences for both human populations and local ecosystems. Addressing climate change is paramount in safeguarding the very habitability of these areas.

Furthermore, it is crucial to recognize that the loss of specific species is sometimes a natural componment of the evolutionary process. Ecosystems are dynamic and constantly evolving, with new species emerging while others gradually fade away. It is important to distinguish between it and the loss of species caused by human activity and focus our efforts on allevating human impacts that accelerate the loss of biodiversity.

To sum up, although the loss of particular species is undoubtedly *a matter of grave concern*, it is imperative a adopt a multifaceted perspective when assessing environmental problems. Climate change, with its far-reaching consequences for coastal cities and beyond, demands urgent attention. While biodiversity conservation remains essential, understanding the broader context of environmental issues will enable us to formulate more effective and comprehensive solutions for *the challenges that lie ahead.*
