## Essay

Following with the unstoppable train called science, Genetic engineering as other technologies *is reshaping* our lives in profound ways. *There are differing viewpoints on its potential impact, with some people anticipating improved lives*, while *others concerns about its uncontrolled nature*, possilby leading to a unpredictable, *regrettable consequences*.

*From a pessimistic perspective*, *genetic engineering remains a relatively novel field with limited experience and established guidelines*. *a minor disruption in the intricate chain of processes could result in catastrophic outcomes*, such as new never-seen virulent virus. Moreover, *ethical dilemmas loom large. For example, *whether employing animals as tools for experimentation is justifiable, given their inability to voice dissent against our actions.*

*Conversely, a more optimistic stance, one that resonates with my viewpoints, emphasizes the potential benefits. Genetic enigneering offers the capacity to address diseases that have failed to be resolved by conventional technologies.* For example, it is possible to create a new skin productively by genetic engineering, which is a amazing news for those patients suffering from skin cancer or *severe burns*. Also, by using genetic engineering, increasing food prduction is visible so that people suffering from hunger can be alleviated.

To sum up, genetic egineering *stands as a transformative force*, not only scientists but also the whole society should be aware of *its advantages and perils*, while it bring us a convenient and better life simultaneously.

## Improvement

In the midst of the relentless progress of science, genetic engineering, like many other technologies advancement, is reshaping our lives in profound ways. There are differing viewpoints on its potential impact, with some people anticipating improved lives, while others concern about its uncontrolled nature, possibly leading to unpredictable consequences.

From a pessimistic perspective, genetic engineering remains a relatively novel field with limited experience and established guidelines. A minor disruption in the intricate chain of processes could result in catastrophic outcomes such as the emergence of a new virulent virus. Moreover, ethical dilemmas loom large, demending thorough consideration and discission For example, Whether employing animal as tools for experimentation is justifiable, given their inability to voice dissent against our actions.

Conversely, a more optimistic stance, one that resonates with my viewpoints, emphasizes the potential benefits. Genetic enigneering offers the capacity to address diseases that have failed to be resolved by conventional technologies. For instance, the prospect of cultivating ~functional~ skin effectively through genetic engineering brings hope to individuals grappling with skin cancer or servere burns. Furthermore, this technology can augment food production, potentially alleviating people's suffering from hunger.

In conclustion, genetic engineering stands as a transformative force, not only scientists but also the whole society should be aware of its advantages and perils. While it undoubtedly brings us a convenient and improved quality life, we should be mindful of its uncontrolled nature and potential risks.
