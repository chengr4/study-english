## Ecxample

In the midst of relentless progress of food industry, numerous food and drink products are manufactured with high levels of sugar. This issue is a matter of considerable concern, given its harmful effects on public health. While I wholeheartly align with the notion of reducing sugar consumption, I must respectfully disagress with the proposal to increase the prices of sugary products. From my perspectivem this approach may not yield the desired outcome.

First and foremost, it is important to acknowledge that prices in a market economy should ideally be determined by the forces of supply and demand. Artificially increasing the cost of sugary products may distort market dynamics, potentially leading to unintended consequences such as the emergence of a black market for sugar. This could ultimately hinder the goal of reducing sugar intake.

A more effective strategy, one that resonates with my viewpoints, emphasizes promoting education and awareness about healthier dietary choices. For instance, encouraging individuals to opt for protein-rich alternatives can play a crucial role in maintaining satiety, *thereby reducing the tendency towards sugary options*. Moreover, studies have demonstrated that abstaining from sugar for as little as two weeks can substantially diminish desires for sweetened products.

Furthermore, it is imperative for governments to collaborate with food manufacturers in implementing transparent labeling practices, providing consumers with clear information about the sugar content in product. This empowers indeividuals to make wise decisions about their dietary habits.

To sum up, while I share the concern about excessive sugar consumption and its damaging effects on heath, I am of the opinion that increasing the prices of sugary products may not be the most effective approach. Instead, a multifaceted stategy encompassing education, awareness and transparent labeling is likely to yield more positive and sustainable results.
