## Essay

Each culture and ~historical~ background have its unicorn. Some people ~emphazise~ that *it is crucial for children to first learn about their own literature and history before delving into other countries' cultures*. I wholehearted agree with this ~perspective~.

Reflecting on my own experience, ~learning~ should always begin with ~familiarity~. Young children *naturally have an interest in the culture* around them. For instance, for Chinese ~speakers~, it is reasonable to ~inquire about~ the origins of ~Kanji~. ~Starting with~ the writing system, understanding the evolution of Kanji and exploring the ~significance~ of each era can help children not only to *recognize the importance of their own heritage* but also *develop a sense of cultural identity*. Moreover, children possessing knowledge about their own culture can apperently have more interest in other countries' cultures. *By appreciating the differences between cultures*, it is evident that children can construct a more beautiful and diverse worldview.

To sum up, it is undeniable that all cultures have their unique ~characteristics~. *Placing emphasis on* one does not imply ignorance of others. Instead, *it contribures to a more organized and comprehensive approach to education*

## Improvement

Every culture and historical background holds its unique essence. Some argue that it is crucial for children to initially immerse themselves in the literature and history of their own country before delving into the cultures of others. I wholeheartedly agree with this perspective.

Reflecting on my own experience, the journey of learning should always commence with a foundation of familiarity. Yound children exhibit a natural curiousity about the world around them. For instance, for Chinese speakers, it is reasonable to seek out the origins of Kanji. Starting with the writing system, comprehending the evolution of Kanji and exploring the significance of each era not only enables children to appreciate the importance of their culture heritage but also fosters a profound sense of cultural identity. Moreover, when childreen possess knowledge about their own culture, they tend to display a heightened interest in other cultures. By recognizing and valuing the differences between cultures, it becomes evident that children can form a more enriched and diverse global perpective.

To sum up, it is undeniable that every culture possesses its distinctive attributes. Placing emphasis on one does not imply ignorance of others. On the contrary, it contibutes to a more organized and comprehensive approach to education.
