In the ever-evolving landscape of the society, there are a few professionals being difficult to replace such as doctors and engineers. However, these types of professionals usually take a country an amount of time and resources to train. Some people contend that these professionals should only serve the country where they have been trained, while other individuals argue that countries have no ~privilege~ to forbid them to leave the country. I wholeheatedly align with the latter perspective.

It is undeniable that the special professionals should give feedbacks to the country, while the country invests a multitude of time and resources on them. For instance, it costs 6 years to foster a doctor in Taiwan and usually needs to update the equipments every period of time because of the innovation of medical technology. If all doctors leave the country and move to a better place by their speciality, the investment of the country will be ~equivalent~ to zero and become meaningless.

Another stance, one that resonates with my viewpoints emphasizes the personal rights and interests. It is reasonable the thought of keeping the professionals in the country. Nevertheless, A permanent time seems too much and ~infeasable~. A contract to decide the ~collaboration~ time with the professionals can be considered as a possible solution. On a side can let professionals granting to the next generation and yield a postive feedback, on the other side can make these professionals able to go to wherever they prefer.

To sum up, while professionals undeniably deserve the freedom for meaning of life pursuit. it is essential to strike a balance between their privilege and country's investment. This balance is vital to the continued development of the ~community~, and will ensure that people can choose these professionals without fear of consequence.

In the ever-evolving landscape of the society, certain professions such as doctors and engineer hold **a level of** of expertise that is challenging to replace. However, trainging these professionals demands a substantial investment of time and resources from their home country. Some contend that these professionals should *be obligated to* serve the nation that provided their training, while others argue that such restrictions violate individual rights. I wholeheartly align with the latter perspective.

Undoubtedly, it is crucial for specialized professionals to give back to their country of training, considering the significant investment made in them. For instance, in Taiwan, it takes 6 years to cultivate a doctor a doctor, and regular updates in equipment are essential due to advancements in medical techmology. If all doctors left the country and moved to a better place by their speciality, the nation's investment would essentially be rendered null and void.

An another stance, one that resonates with my viewpoints emphasizes the personal rights and interests. While it is reasonable to expect professionals to contribute to their home country, imposing a permannent obligation seems impractial and overly restrictive. A contractual agreement specifying a mutually agreed upon period of collaboration could be a feasible solution. This way, professinals can pas on their expertise to the next generation, providing a positve *feedback loop*, while also affording them the freedom to pursue opportunities worldwide.

To sum up, while it is imperative to honor the investment a country makes in training professionals, it is equally important to respect their individual freedoms. Striking this balance is crucial for the continued progess of society and ensures that people can benefit from the expertise of these professionals without fear of consequence.
