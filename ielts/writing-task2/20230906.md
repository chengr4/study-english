## Essay

In the midst of relentless progress of science, artificial intelligence, like many other technological advancement, is reshaping our lives in profound ways. There are differeing viewpoints on its potential impact, with some people anticipating improved lives, while others concern about its uncontrolled attributes, for example, AI may become smarter than human beings.

From a pessmistic perspective, aritificial intelligence remains a relatively navel field with limited experience and established ~guidelines~. ~A~ ~trivial~ mistake can result in catastrophic outcomes such as computers start to have their own ~consciousness~ and destroy the original human-given plan. Moreover, Technology abuse ~looms~ large, demending thorough consideration and restriction. For example, criminals use fake information rapidly produced by AI to grain benefits.

Conversely, a more optimistic stance, one that resonates with my viewpoints, emphasizes the potential benefits. AI does offer the capacity to accelerate addressing diseases that have been almost stopped by conventional technologies. For instance, the accurate prediction of protein by AI brings hope to make new medicines against virus. Futhermore, AI can be a great teacher answering the question which may take a long time to find in the old day.

To sum up, AI stands as a transformative force, not only experts but individuals should be aware of its advantages and perils. While it undoutedly brings us a convenienct and improved life, we should be mindful of it uncontrolled nature and potentail risks.

In the midst of the relentless progress of science, aritifical intelligence like many other technological advancements, is reshpaing our lives in profound ways. There are differing viewpoints on its potential impact, with some people anticipating improved lives, while others express concern about its uncontrolled development, particularly the possiblilty of AI surpassing human intelligence.

From a pessimistic perspective, AI remains a relatively new field with limited experience and established guidelines. Even a seemingly trivial mistake could result in catastrophic outcomes, such as computers gaining their own consciousness and deviating from the original human-designed plan. Moreover, the misuse of technology looms large, demanding careful consideration and regulation. For instance, criminals can exploit fake information repidly generatedd by AI **for their gain**.

Conversely, a more optimistic stance, one that resonates with my viewpoints, emphasizes the potential benefits of AI. AI offers the capacity to **accelerate progress in** addressing diseases that conventional technologies **have struggled with**. For example, AI's ability to accurately predict protein structures **holds promise** for developing new medicines to combat viruses. Furthermore, AI can act as an efficient teacher, answering questions that might habe taken a long time to find in the past.

To sum up, AI stands as **a trasformative force**, and it is crucial for both experts and individuals to be aware of its advantages and perils. While it undeniably brings us convenience and an improved quality of life, we **must remain mindful** of its incontrolled nature and potential risks.
