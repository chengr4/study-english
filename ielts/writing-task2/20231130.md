## Example

In the midst of relentless societal progress, the pressure on young people to focus on academic subjects has been increasing, and a subject of debate that non-academic subjects, such as PE and cookery, should be expunged from the school syllabus to let children concentrate on academic work. I firmly disagree with this perspective, as I believe that success in life is not solely **contingent on** academic achievements.

First and foremost, the idea that being academically successful equates to success in career is **a fallacy**. Life is multifaceted, requiring individuals to possess a diverse set of skils, not just academic knowledge. Non-academic subjects, such as physical education and cookery, contribute significantly to the holistic development of an individual. For example, Basketball can foster qualites such as teamwork and leadership and cooking can help students develop life skills such as time management and organizing steps. These skills are invaluable in real-world scenarios.

Moreover, numerous studies emphasize the **symbiotic relationship** between academic and non-adademic pursuits. PE, for instance, has been shown to **enhance cognitive function** and **promote an active pattern of thinking**. Students engaged in regular physical activity often display improved concentration and problem-solving skills, highlighting the complementary nature of academic and non-academic disciplines.

Futhermore, advoating for the removal of non-academic subjects overlooks the fact that some students may discover their passions and talents in these areas. For instance, a student with preference for **culinary arts** may **find their calling** in cookery, leading to a successful and fulfilling career in the culinary industry. Restricting the curriculum to purely academic subjects could surpress the exploration and development of such talents.

To sum up, **dismissing** non-academic subjects from the school syllabus is a short-sighted approach that neglects the importance of a well-rounded education. The combination of academic and non-academic subjects not only preares students for the complexities of life but also allows them to discover and cultivate their individual strengths and talents, ultimately contributing to their overall success.
