It is a say that people only persue the wave for a short time rather than really treat it as a lifetime hobby. However, I totally disagree with it, and believe  people will eventually find their own hobby somehow.

Reflecting on my own experience, it was very popular that people are encouraged to go to gym in past few years. I was also fortunate to have an experienced friend which could guide me how to workout in the gym. Following with going of time, it is apperently that some people remained and I could still always see them in the gym. This is what I said poeple will finally find their lifetime hobby rather than being only doing the "trend" in a short time.

To sum up, Though there is a new interest being popular in a period and people are therefore able to experience tons of new things. And they will undeniably follow their mind and find one they certainly love it and keep doing on it.

Fortunately, **a seasoned friend** served as a knowledgeable mentor, guiding me **through the intricacies of exercise**. This initial trend soon envolved into a genuine hobby, solidifying my commitment to a healthier lifestyle. Over time, I observed a cohort of individuals who, like me, transitioned from trend followers to dedicated participants, attesting to the power of authentic interests.

**It is irrefutable that** societal trends **wield** a considerable influence, temporarily elevating specific acitivites to the **zenith of popularity**. However, beneath the surface, individuals possess an innate drive to seek fulfillment through activities that resonate with their intrinsic desires. **The ephemeral nature of trends becomes apparent as they ebb and flow, yet the enduring pursuit of one's true passions prevails.**
