- I have a bad experience, when I was learning English, No matter how hard I tried, I still can't read English effectively. I finally find out the system of english and the system of Chinese are totally different unlike other latin languate. I can not use the way I understand chinese to study => I do not userstand the nature of learning english

## Example

In certain societies, children are encouraged with the belief that they have the potential to accomplish anything through suffient effort and determination I partially agree with this statement. Besides effort and determination, there are other significant factors at play.

First and foremost, having a good mentor can make a world of difference. A mentor cna provide guidance, share experiences, and even streamline the learning process. They can lead a child in the right direction, helping them avoid common pitfalls cna providing valuable insights. Futhermore, understnading the nature of what one os pursuing is essential. This means gaining a deep comprehension of the subject matter, its underlying principles and the skills required. For instance, in the case of learning a language like English, it is vital to grasp the funcamental differences between linguistic systems. Without this understanding, even the most dedicated efforts may not yield the desired results.

Setting concrete and realistic goals is equally important. Not everyone can become a world champion in their chosen filed. It is crucial to acknowledge and celebrate achievements at various levels. Attaining a certain degree of proficiency or competence can be a significant accomplishment in itself.

I can relate to this from my own experience. When I was learning English, no matter how hard I tried, I struggled to read effectively. It was not until I realized that the systems of English and Chinese are fundamentally different that *I began to make progress*. Understanding this key distinction allowed me to adjust my approach to learning, ultimately leading to improved proficiency.

To sum up, while hard work and determination are undeniably important, they are not the sole factors in achieving success. Having a mentor, understanding the nature of the pursuit and setting realistic goals are all vital elements in helping children reach their full potential.
