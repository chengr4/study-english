## Ideas

- agree
- people tend to use slang. eg. in germany, Rewe is a kind of supermarket. instead of saying go to super market, they say go to Rewe which you never learn in school unless you live there.
- if you unluckily have argument with someone, you can't express yourself well and can even be hard to get help from the community
- Therefore, same language speakers tend to gather together ad sometimes it enlarges the gap between the group and the local community

## Example

I wholeheartedly agree with the notion that residing in a contry where one must communicate in a foreign language can give rise to siginificant social and practical difficulties. Having experienced this firsthand during my time in Germany, I have come to understand the profound impact it can have on an individual's daily life.

One prominent issue is **the emergence of slang within the local language**. For instance, In Germany, the term "Rewe" is commonly used to refer to supermarkets. This kind of dialect is not typically taught in formal language courses, and newcomers may find it perplexing. Consequently, even basic task like *grocery* shopping can become unexpectedly challenging, leading to frustration and a sense of isolation.

Moverover, when disagreements arise, effective communication can be severely hindered. Expressing oneself in a language that is not native often results in a loss of nuance and emotional depth. I vividly recall an incident where a minor disagreement escalated due to my inability to convey my point of view clearly. This incident left me felling isolated and helpless, struggling to navigate the complexities of the situation.

The linguistic barrier can also lead to the formation of linguistic enclaves. People who share the same native language naturally tend to gravitate towards one another, seeking comfort and mutual understanding. While this is a natural response to the challenges of living in a foreign linguistic enviroment, it can unintentionally deepen the divide between these communities and the local society. This seperation can hinder a person from fully integrating into the local community.

To sum up, living in a country where a foreign language is spoken indeed poses social and practical challenges. The emergence of slang, difficulties in experssing oneself during conversations and the potential for linguistic enclaves all contribute to this complex issue. While adaption is possible, it is curcial to acknowledge and address these challenges to foster a move inclusive and harnonious society.
