In the midst of the relentless societal progress, New types of jobs emerge one by one. Unlike following the convention of being an employee in a company, more and more people decide to become a freelancer. This new form of working offers several benefits such as freedom. However, it can also lead to some disadvantages or perils that individuals overlook.

First and foremost, as I mention in the fist paragraph, the predominant reason that individuals decide to be self-employed is freedom. A employee in the company has a multitude of rules to follow like being on time to the company or working 8 hours per day. There are some handful and annoying implict ragulations. For example, only if the leader leaves the company, the other people are allowed to leave. In contrast, Being self-employed can basically avoid these rules. I have a quite impressive experience about this. Once, I took an Uber for visiting grandparents. After chatting with the driver, he told me that he was able to sleep until afternoon and started his working. I could't help but be jealous to this situation.

Neverthless, to become a successful freelancer is also not as easy as people imagine, especially, the begin of doing it. It is very common that one should find one's first customers, sometimes taking 1 or 2 years. People can either has zero income or spend extra time to find it after a tiring working day. What is more fustrating is that it can also fail. Futhermore, even if having stable customers, it does not promise that income stays in the same sability. Unlike employees have the same salaries every month, freelancers can earn much money this month but have no income in the next few months. This up and down might cause nervous or a sense of stressfull mind of freelancers.

To sum up, While being employed in the company offers stable salaries and life but requires to obey numerous rules, freelancers are able to use themslves' time freely, which is *positive* to the mental health, but also have to overcome the *instability* of economy. Poeple should choose wisely and find the most suitable way for themself.

Employees in a company are bound by a multitude of rules, from punctuality to mandatory hours of work. Besides, implicit regulations can both restrictive and frustrating. For instance, one can only leave once the supervisor departs. In contrast, being self-employed allows one to sidestep these constraints.

I couldn't help but feel **a twinge of envy** at this situation.
