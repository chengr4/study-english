## Essay

In the midst of relentless societal progress, the role of education has become a focal point of many and what university should play in this process remains a subject of intense debate. While some argue that students have the previlege to choose their favorite interests, others contend that the university should only offer subjects that are useful in the future. I wholeheartedly align with the former perspective, believing that multifaceted development is the role university should play and can lead students to a brighter life.

First and foremost, Universities are not professional fostering factories. These assignments should be taken care by work-oriented training insititute. The essence of universities is to encompass a wide range of knowledge in many areas, focus on exploring the depth of knowledge, and provide a platform for students to access the latest research results and develop their own interests among them. For instance, through combining the knowledge of history, design and literature, a touching story in a game can be created. This is a typical example of the cooperation of different disciplines. poeple studying only one subject can hardly achieve this goal.

Furthermore, It is hard to predict and define what will be useful in the future. The world is changing rapidly, and the knowledge that is useful today may be useless tomorrow. For example, the knowledge of how to use a computer was not useful in the past, but it is very useful now. Therefore, it is not wise to limit the scope of knowledge that students can learn. Instead, students should be encouraged to learn as much as possible, and they should be given the freedom to choose what they want to learn.
