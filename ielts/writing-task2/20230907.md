## Essay

In the ever-evolving landscape of media ~communication~, The ~art~ of advertising constantly develops and captivates our attention, compelling us to continuously acquire new ~products~. I firmly agree that goods we buy *often go beyond what is truly needed*

Reflecting on my own experience, it is very common to hear ~~that there is~~ a new version of the iPhone,leading poeple to dicide to change the old one just because the advertisement declares the new one has been impoved the performance to some degree. It is totally reasonable to upgrade to a more evolved one while it is a must. For instance, as ~a~ Youtuber, an ~iPhone~ with a longer ~battery life~ and a sharper ~camera lens~ *elevates the quality of the work*. However, ~as a resident of Earth~, we would be wise to always think twice before *making a new purchase~ in order to better oreserce the only place we *call home*

To sum up, Although advertisement usually brings us the improvement of products, we should also notice the temption along with it and carefully purchase things which really have implication to us.

## Improvement

In the rapidly ever-evolving landscape of media and communication, the art of advertising continues to advance, commanding our attention and compelling us to frequently acquire new products. I wholeheartedly agree with the perspective that our purchases often extend beyond genuine necessity.

Relfecting on my own experience, it is commonplace to encouter the release of a new iPhone model, prompting individuals to replace their existing one solely based on the attractive claims made in the advertisements. There is cetainly merit in upgrading to a more advanced model when it serves a vital purpose. For instance, in a role as a Youtuber, a phone with an extended battery life and an enhanced camera lens significantly elevates the quality of the work. However, as a responsible inhabitant of the earth, it is incumbent upon us to exercise prudence and deliberate before making a purchase, ensuring that we uphold the well-being of our shared environment.

To sum up, while adverting typically heralds product enhancements, it is imperative that we remain mindful of the allure it yields. We should approach our purchases with discernment, selecting items that truly hold significance and value to us.
