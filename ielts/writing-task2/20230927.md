In the midst of the relentless progress of contemporary advertising, a prevailing strategy is to underscore the novelty of products. This appraoch serves multiple purposes, primarily aiming to stimulate consumer interest and purchases. I wholeheartedly align with this trend, as it is a positive development benefiting both businesses and consumers.

First and foremost, businesses emphasize the newness of their products to **tempt consumers into making a purchase**. By presenting a product as new or innovative, companies create a sense of excitement and curiosity among potnetial buyers, potnetially leading to increased sales, as consumers are naturally drawn to explore and experience the latest offerings.

Moreover, the emphasis on new products often implies that adopting them can lead to an improved quality of life. For instance, in the modern era, smartphones have become versatile tools, serving functions ranging from information retrieval and communication with others to reading books and watching dramas. they have steamlined tasks that in the past required multiple appraoches.

Furthermore, in stark constrast to two centuries ago, when even emperors lacked access to modern amenities, today's average person can afford and enjoy a standard of living that was once unimaginable such as air conditioning and showering. This is largely thanks to the ability to purchase a variety of goods  and services that enhance our lives.
