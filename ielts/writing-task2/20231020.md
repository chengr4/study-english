In the midst of the relentless progress of the seciety. The complexity of education gradually increases, causing the prior subject to learn also becomes difficult to opt for. Some people contend that History should be the most pivotal one, while other individuals argue that Science and Technology are more important. I wholeheartedly align with the latter viewpoint, believing that Science and Technology can change one's life.

It is undeniable that History plays a crucial role among of subjects at school. The predominent function of History encompasses learning human's mistake in the past. It has already been an axiom that changes does not promise success but doing the same mistakes repeatly is destined to failure. However, this knowledge or understanding can only be applied at some specific moment, leading to the less of the application and job positions relatively.

In contrast, Science and Technology basically establish the landscape of the whole world. Most of objects surrounding us are corresponding to a type of science. For example, Cars are the crystal of Science. Metals to choose for car skin belongs to material science. Engines driving cars is a part of physics. Moreover, modern cars usually include a software device which should contibute to computer science. Through applying Science and Technology, human beings relentlessly create novel values letting our lives more and more convenient.

To sum up, Every subjects have it own value and property. History teaching poeple to prevent mistakes in the past can only be applies in some moment, while learning Science and Technology can keep creating new application and improve our well-being.

In the midst of society's relentless progress, the complexity of education has gradually increased, making the choice of a primary subject more challenging. Some argue that Histroy should hold the utmost importance, while others contend that Science and Technology *take precedence*. I wholehearly align with the latter viewpoint, believing that Science and Technology have the power to transform lives.

Undoubtedly, History plays a pivotal among school subjects. Its primary function lies in learning from humanity's past mistakes. It is widely acknowledged that change does not gurantee success, but repeating the same mistakes is destined for failure. However, this knowledge is often applicable only in a specific context, leading to fewer opportunities for its application and job prospects.

An another stance, resonating with my viewpoints, emphasized the importance of  Science and Technology.  Science and Technology form the bedrock of the modern world. Nearly everythin around us correspends to some form of scientific principle. For instance, cars are a manifestation of scientific knowledge. The choice of metals for the car's structure **falls under** the realm of material science, while the engines propelling cars are a product of physics. Futhermore, modern cars often incorporate software, which is a product of computer science. Through the application of Science and Technology. humans continually create new values that enhance our lives, making them more convenient and efficent.

To sum up, every subject holds its own value and significance. History teaches us to avoid the mistakes of the past, but its applicability is often limited to specific contexts. On the other hand, the study of Science and Technology leads to the continual creation of new applications, ultimately enhancing our well-being. It we must choose only one subject to study, I filmly believe that the latter is the wiser choice.
