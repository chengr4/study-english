## Essay

In the midst of relentless progress of technology. Information loader seems to gradually shift from paper to electronic devices. Some people believe that buying printed newspapers or books to read will be replaced with reading online for free. I will distinguish my perspectives into two layers: newspapers and books. I wholeheartedly align with the perspective that newspapers will be altered. However, with books, I do not agree with it.

Towards newspapers, from my perspective, it will be 100% replaced with the internet as time goes. While the main feature of newspapers is about offering people the newest information or sitations in the world, with its speedy widespread attribute. However, this attribute is still slower than spreading information on the internet. Furthermore, even though it is very cheap to buy newpapers, costing merely 1 USD, individuals tend to use the internet which is free.

Books, on the other hand, always possess complicated and profound knowledge. Individuals should slow down oneself in order to comprehend knowledge that books offer. Moreover, a multitude of studies suggest that reading online makes people easier distracted over books. The blue light of electronic devices continuously stimulating user's eyes makes them lose their patient, while books offer more comfortable tactile impression that readers can therefore study and acquire knowledge quietly.

To sum up, while it is evident that reading online without spending money assault the paper related market, only newspapers get a significant effect based on its properties. Books containing profound knowledge are more difficult to be replaced.

## Improvement

In the midst of relentless technological progress, the consumption of infornation is gradually shifting from traditional paper-based soruces to electronic devices. Some argue that the practice of purchasing printed newspapers or books will become obsolete as people can access content online without any cost. I will discuss my perspectives on this issue in two distinct categories: newspapers and books. While I wholeheartedly agree with the notion that newspapers will likely be replaced, I disagree when it comes to books.

Rdgarding newspapers, I believe that they are destined to be completely replaced by online sources in the near future. Newpapers primiarily serve the purpose of delivering the latest news and updates from around the world, priding thenselves on their swiftness in spreading information. However, this speed **pales in comparison** to the instantaneous nature of the internet. Furthermore, despite the low cost of purchasing newspapers, typically around 1 USD or so, individuals are increasingly inclined to use the interent where content is freely available.

Books, on the other hand, odffer a unique and invaluable experience. They often contain in-depth and complex knowledge that requires readers to slow down and **immerse themself** in the subject matter. Numerous studies have indicated that reading online can lead to greater distraction compared to reading phsical books. The blue light emitted by electronic devices can **strain the eyes** and reduce patience, whereas books offer a more comfortable tactile experience that allows readers to quietly study and absorb knowledge.

To sum up, while **it is undeniable that free online content poses a significant challenge to the print industry**, the impact varies depending on the medium. Newspaper, with their emphasis on timeliness, are more vulnerable to being replaced by online sources. However, books, with their wealth of profound knowledge and the immersive reding experience they provide, are less likely to be replaced by the digital realm.
