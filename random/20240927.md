Russia Today and Sputnik spread fake stories or unsubstantiated rumors about European politicians and regularly “pump out gloom about Europe, cheer about Russia and boosterism for pro-Russian populist parties,” according to The Economist (paywall).

the authors of a large MIT study wrote in 2018, fake news does so well online “because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.”
