- False Frames

By searching a claim and getting a story from a news source that has a verification process in place you not only verify the claim, but you end up with a better story to share with others. We call this "trading up." The idea behind trading up is that you can use social media to discover stories relevant to you, but when you find the stories, take a moment to "zoom out" and get the best reporting or analysis on it, rather than simply reading the specific article that happens to find its way to you.

通過搜索一個聲明並從有核實過程的新聞來源獲得故事，你不僅能夠驗證這個聲明，還能得到一個更好的故事來分享給他人。我們稱之為「升級交易」。升級交易的想法是，你可以利用社交媒體來發現與你相關的故事，但當你找到這些故事時，花一點時間「放大」一下，獲得最佳報導或分析，而不僅僅是閱讀恰好出現在你面前的特定文章。
